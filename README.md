## Data-Mining-from-Large-Data-Sets

#### The goal of this project is to develop a program that finds duplicate videos. The videos were provided
as shingles in a text file. There was also a training set for the video data. The program needed to
run on a Map Reduce environment and should be developed with a Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)
algorithm.

## Environment

#### The running environment with a Map Reduce framework was provided. So the Mapper and Reducer
were developed independently and then submitted to the running environment.

## This project shows that LSH is a nice approach to find near duplicates in a large set of videos. It can
be simply developed in a Map Reduce environment.
